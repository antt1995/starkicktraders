Starkick Traders is a game of strategy in which you trade, build empires and try to take over the galaxy. It's a multiplayer persistent universe.
The game code is written in PHP was based on the Open Source BlackNova Traders. The code forked in 2001 to work better on wireless PDA, such as the Handspring Treo and ultimately the Sidekick. A lot of the BNT code has been rewritten although the visual format remains very similar when played on a PC.
Additional functionality includes multiple ships and the ability to build ships.
