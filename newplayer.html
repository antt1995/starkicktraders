      <P><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">Begin 
        a new life in the off-world colonies! The Federation is giving away ships 
        and credits to promote exploration and colonization of the known galaxy. 
        Where will you go from there? Build a huge galactic empire or start a 
        warrior space clan? It's up to you. </font>
      <P><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">What 
        ever you decide, credits are the fuel of your dreams. Trading makes you 
        money. Trade goods between space ports to earn credits, upgrade your ship 
        and trade some more. Buy better weaponry, more powerful engines, and anything 
        else that you think will come in handy. Aim for planet colonization. Find, 
        build or steal a planet and fill it with enough people to make goods and 
        money for you. Build a base and defend you planets, get three planet bases 
        in a sector and you'll own the sector. <br>

        is a dangerous place. It is life or death out there, but the Federation 
        does not look kindly on those who prey on new colonists. Even so, in the 
        early days you might want to hang out in the safety of Federation space. 
        If you want to be a bounty hunter - have we got firepower and equipment 
        for you! You can earn big credits for hunting down the dirt of the universe! 
        The Federation pays triple the usual salvage rate for fugitive scrap.</font></P>
      <P><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">The 
        game resets when the winners are obvious to the administrator. Each game 
        lasts about 4 weeks but it could be longer, could be shorter. Top scores 
        come from maxing out your ship, your planets, owning the most sectors 
        and doing it in the most efficient way possible.</font></P>

        Rules</font></h1>
      <p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" color="#FFFFFF">These 
        are the key rules of the Game:</font></p>
      <ol>
        <li><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" color="#FFFFFF">No 
          swearing, foul language or cussing in the forums, beacons, planet names, 
          ship names, in messages to other players or anywhere else. First offense 
          we'll warn you. Second offense your account will be suspended. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Play 
          only one account. Multi-accounts spoil the game. If you need an additional 
          account for some reason ask!</font></li>
        <li><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" color="#FFFFFF">The Admin has ultimate authority and final decision - life isn't fair. 
          The admin governs the game very lightly - some may say not at all, so 
          don't complain to the Admin.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" color="#FFFFFF">These are the rules, everything else is just advice or guidance. Any 
          documentation is provided AS IS and if it's wrong tell us but don't 
          expect compensation.</font></li>
