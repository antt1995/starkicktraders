#summary Intro and history

= Introduction =

Starkick Traders is a web-based game written in PHP. It is a multiplayer game that runs continuously 24 hours a day. Games can run perpetually, however, in practice it is typical for games to be reset after about 3 or 4 weeks as one player or an aliance of players will usually become extremely dominant after that period of time.   

= History =
Starkick Traders was developed from the BlackNova Traders code base. The code fork was made for the following reasons:

  * To implement new features, such as multiple ship ownership and email alerts
  * To fix a massive number of bugs rapidily
  * To rewrite code to make it more efficient
  * To format the output of the game to fit on small screen devices

The game was initially launched February 2003 by Berigames Inc. as a subscription based game targeted at the T-Mobile Sidekick but also available for play on any web browser enabled device, including PC's.

Since then it has been hosted on multiple web sites.
